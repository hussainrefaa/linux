1. Upload the cmc.tgz file to your server
lynx http://configserver.com/free/cmc.tgz
2. Untar the distribution:

tar -xzf cmc.tgz

3. cd into the directory created and run the install script:

cd cmc/
sh install.sh

4. service cpanel restart
5. Login to WHM and scroll to the bottom of the left hand menu and you should see "ConfigServer ModSecurity Control"


If you want to uninstall, simply:

cd /usr/src
rm -fv /usr/src/cmc.tgz
wget http://www.configserver.com/free/cmc.tgz
tar -xzf cmc.tgz
cd cmc
sh uninstall.sh
rm -Rfv /usr/src/cmc*

Note: This won't remove the mod_security files and rules which you will need to do manually within /usr/local/apache/conf/
